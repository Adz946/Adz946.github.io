        <h2>Project Idea</h2>

        <h4>Overview</h4>

        <p>
            Motivation. Enjoyment. Need. <br>
            Those are the answers to the question: “What does it take to be healthy?”. <br>
            UP, my diet/exercise health application idea will be made to embody those answers. <br>

            To put it’s functions shortly, UP will take a few questions relating to current health, weight, 
            goal weight, average movement, food allergies, food eaten (vegan/vegetarian/meat), etc. 
            to craft the perfect exercise plan along with lists of healthy foods to consider and their recipes.
            <br>
            To keep motivation up, UP will have small features such as quote of the day, physical hobbies, an 
            informational about the importance of the selected exercises/foods as well as video how tos. <br>
        </p>

        <h4>Motivation</h4>

        <p>
            There are many websites out there. Many apps. Many gyms. <br>
            All of these have the specific purpose of trying to keep/get people healthy or at the very least 
            somewhat active. 
            <br>
            Exercising isn’t the only way to keep/get healthy either, food is a very important factor that 
            can make or break your entire routine.
            <br>
            So why make something like all the rest?
            <br>
            Because I can make it better. <br>
            Because I can make it bolder. <br>
            Because these sites and apps may give some help, but lack in terms of motivation. <br>
            Because who wouldn’t want a personalised routine? <br>
            Because, as easy as it should be, making yourself healthier is actually very hard 
            <i>and we could all use a little help sometimes.</i> <br>
        </p>

        <h4>Description</h4>

        <p>
            UP will set up your routine / plan by doing the following - <br>
            Asking important questions <br>
            Using 2 premade databases to go through and select specific items off it <br>
            Formatting those selected options into an easily readable plan / routine to work towards <br>

            After the plan is made the user will be taken to the main page of the app where they will be able 
            to do or go to the following - <br>
            View their plan <br>
            Check out recommended food / snack recipes <br>
            Set reminders / alarms to exercise <br>
            View videos or written methods on how to do the selected exercises <br>
            Use the random quote generator <br>
            Use the physical hobby generator as well as find locations to do said hobbies outside of 
            home <br>
            Recommend sites / stores near the user for sport / exercise / healthy food related stuff 
            (e.g. weights) 
            <br>
            The app will also have an informational, a section solely dedicated to providing information 
            as to why what was recommended is important. <br>
        </p>

        <h4>Tools, Tech and Skill</h4>

        <p>
            UP will be a mobile app that will utilise the following to make it work - <br>
            Server <br>
            Scripting - Node.JS <br>
            Database - Microsoft SQL <br>
            Backend - Firebase (works on Android & IOS) <br>

            To write the code/script, Visual Studio Code will be used. As for hardware, all that is needed 
            is a keyboard, mouse and screen (monitor or laptop screen). In the Intro to IT course, it is 
            very likely that those skills are not available or are limited.<br>
        </p>

        <h4>Outcome</h4>

        <p>
            If the project is successful, people will have a pretty great health app (literally) in their hands.
            <br>
            The original problem is that anything we can learn online is a generalisation of exercises / 
            diets without much of a personal plan. This app can help with that by making it a personalised 
            journey.
