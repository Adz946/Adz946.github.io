        <h2>Project Idea</h2>

        <h3>Overview</h3>

        <p>
            <b>Oblituma is a digital trading card game idea of my own creation.</b> <br><br>

            <u>A brief overview of how it works -</u> <br><br>

            The aim of the game is to get your opponent's Vita to 0 <br>

            Each card has a set Card Point (CP) <br><br>

            There are two types of cards - <br><br>

            <b>Creature</b> <br>
            A creature’s CP can be divided up into Battle Points (BP) and Gear Points (GP) <br>
                > BP - Used to determine the outcome in a clash <br>
                > GP - Used to determine the gear the creature is able to use <br><br>

            <b>Gear</b> <br>
            Gear is used to - <br>
                > enhance the targeted card’s BP or GP <br>
                > give the targeted card an ability <br>
                > affect surrounding cards <br>
            A gear card’s GP is lower, but never equal to it’s CP <br><br>

            A player’s Vita is equal to the grand total of Card Points (CP) in their deck. <br>
            Vita can be anything between 4750 - 5250 <br>

            Damage is calculated with - (Higher BP - Lower BP) * 100 - and the losing card is sent to 
            the bottom of the deck. Unless exiled, in which case it is sent to The Shadows. <br><br>

        </p>

        <h3>Motivation</h3>

        <p>
            The game won’t be useful to society, it will be fun though. <br><br>

            I’ve planned it to be an interesting story of betrayal, survival, tragedy, and magic told by 
            progressing through the game’s story mode and collecting the notes of the faction Lords. 
            Each faction has a story to tell, each faction has notes to go through, each faction just 
            wants to survive… <i>Can they?</i> <br><br>

            As well as story mode, there will be online mode, in which the player can find a random 
            online match as well as set up a match against a friend. <br><br>

        </p>

        <h3>Description</h3>

        <p>
            <u>Story Information - </u> <br>
            <i> 50 years… <br>
                Foretold by seers. <br>
                Prophesied by Oracles. <br>
    
                I didn’t want to admit it then, what a fool I've been. 
                The world… <b>our</b> world is dying. I could have prevented it, we all could have. <br><br>
    
                When we had received the news we laughed, after all, how would we have known… 
                How <b>could</b> we have known? <br><br>
    
                …There were earthquakes in the beginning, cities were swallowed whole, millions died. 
                Looking back, it was the clue we shouldn’t have missed. <br><br>
    
                Out of fear, the people divided into factions, each attempting to prolong their fate. 
                The final disaster was dubbed the “Eternal End”. <br><br>
    
                The planet’s core was an iron filled ball of magic, one we had learned to wield for our own 
                prosperity. Runes were our scientific creations to wield that power, the only thing that 
                rivaled this power were the Gear-Borns. That same core is bringing about our end. <br><br>
    
                I have created this, and many other notes to anyone alive after the end. <br>
                So that the truth could be seen. <br>
                So that you understand. <br>
                So that you learn. <br><br>
    
                When going through them, please, keep in mind that the terror of the end can change a man’s 
                thinking long before he realises it. <br>
            </i>

            <u>Game Information -</u> <br>
            The game progresses through note collection. <br>
            You unlock a note → you play through the story within → you gain the notes within <br><br>

            Notes contain the stories of each faction’s attempt at survival.  Play through each faction’s 
            stories to earn the final story - The Eternal End <br><br>

            Alternatively, a note can contain a side story about the lore of the world of Oblituma. 
            These notes will be optional in regards to unlocking the Eternal End, but will have some 
            interesting rewards like cards, card sleeves, mats, pack unlocks. <br><br>

            This is a card game, so a deck editor and booster packs will be featured as well as the digital 
            currency to buy those packs. Accessories like card sleeves and mats will be used too. <br><br>

            This game will have a multiplayer mode that features both local and online play.
            If it can be figured out, local play could be played on the same internet on different devices 
            while online would be the normal online play that any other card game has. <br><br>

            <u>Card Information -</u> <br>
            Creature cards can be divided into the following - <br>

        <h3>Tools, Tech and Skill</h3>

        <p>
            For the hardware / software, nothing too special is needed although a drawing tablet would 
            be helpful. All that is really required is a - <br>
            > Laptop/Computer/Tablet <br>
            > Keyboard (doesn’t have to glow) <br>
            > Mouse <br>
            > Code editor (e.g. Visual Studio, Python Idle) <br>
            > Unity 
            > Graphic design tool (e.g. Adobe Illustrator, Gravit Designer) <br>
            > Pencil & Paper(s) <br><br>
            As for the skills - <br>
            > Drawing (digital or paper) <br>
            > Coding <br>
            > Imagination <br>
            > Ideas <br><br>
            In an IT course, I'd expect at least a few people to know some coding basics (strings, ints, 
            arrays/lists, etc.). The real problem I expect to encounter is the one of art. I personally know 
            how to do some basic pixel art, and have been learning to improve those skills. I can also make some 
            ok drawings, although great drawing skills would be the skill to find for this project. <br><br>
        </p>

        <h3>Outcome</h3>

        <p>
            <b>This is a game.</b> <br>
            Oblituma isn’t going to be made to be useful or to help anyone, it’ll be made for enjoyment, 
            entertainment and most importantly, for fun. <br><br>

            <b>It isn’t useful to society.</b> <br>
            An personalised workout app would be useful to society (long as it’s used), so would a personalised 
            diet plan app, or an extreme security system plan, or a size identifier, or an A.I. that can keep 
            full track of all missile weaponry with LOUD warnings of when and where they go off. <br><br>

            <b>It’s made for the sake of fun.</b> <br>
            This is none of those things. This is a video game that would be played in the form of a card game. 
            It will be made for entertainment and a temporary cure for boredom. <br><br>
